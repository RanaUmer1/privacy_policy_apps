        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 15, 2026</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Pdf Converter</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>a. Files and Documents</h3>
        <p>To provide the PDF conversion service, the App requires access to the documents you wish to convert. When you upload a file for conversion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The file is transmitted securely to our conversion server.</li>
            <li>The file is processed solely for the purpose of conversion.</li>
            <li><strong>Files are automatically deleted</strong> from our servers immediately after the conversion is complete or after a short period (typically 1 hour) to ensure your privacy.</li>
            <li>We do not read, analyze, or share the content of your documents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. Device and Usage Data</h3>
        <p>We may collect non-personal information about your device and how you use the App, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers.</li>
            <li>App usage data, such as features used and crash logs.</li>
            <li>IP address (for general location and security purposes).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. These services help us analyze app performance and serve advertisements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> We use AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may use cookies and device identifiers to serve personalized ads. <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Learn more about Google's Ad privacy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> We use Firebase to understand how users interact with our App to improve its functionality. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Learn more about Firebase privacy</a>.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in providing us your information and files. We use commercially acceptable means of protecting it, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypted transmission (HTTPS/SSL) for all file uploads and downloads.</li>
            <li>Strict retention policies where user files are deleted automatically.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
